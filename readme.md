# Simple Todo List

[Access The Application Here](https://eviltester.github.io/simpletodolist/todolists.html)

Originally based on the Vanilla JS TodoMVC project.

Then amended to support multiple lists, and a password protected 'admin' section. Code heavily amended to adopt a simpler coding style, 

Designed to be a simple, self contained and controllable Test Application, rather than a JavaScript Showcase.

This is used as the test application for the Linkedin Learning Course:
